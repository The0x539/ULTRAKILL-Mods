# BetterWeaponWheel
I don't really use the weapon wheel in ULTRAKILL, but that's in part because it kinda sucks.
This mod makes a few improvements:

- There are now icons on each segment that indicate which weapon you're selecting.
- The segments will actually match what you have equipped. If you unequip some weapons, there can be fewer than three segments. If you enable the spawner arm or have some modded weapons, there can be more than five.
- There's a tiny cursor that indicates your mouse position within the wheel.

# Screenshots
Please give me some good ones!

# Installation
Same as RcHud.
