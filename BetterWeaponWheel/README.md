# BetterWeaponWheel
This mod used to be a sort of predecessor to the weapon wheel changes made in patch 13a.
Now the improvements it provides are a lot more minor:

- The weapon icons represent the actual weapon that you'd be switching to, not just the first weapon in the slot.
- The highlight color for the icon is the color of the weapon, rather than always red.
- There's a tiny cursor to indicate your mouse position within the wheel.
