A WIP experimental mod that I thought might be cool, inspired by the damage numbers (and various other splash text) from TF2.
In reality, it doesn't seem super practical, but here it is anyway.

No release at the moment. If you want to use this, you'll need to compile it yourself.

Maybe there's just some special sauce this is missing that would make it actually worth using, I don't know. Ideas welcome.
